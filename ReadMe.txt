       CONSOLE APPLICATION : SimpleGLUT
========================================================================

This is a console application to demo the Flying Bird Wings Simulator.

The main idea of this application is to define the behavior of the bird's wings in details based.
The behavior is generated by Euler anger rotation and the Physics laws.
Multiply the rotation and translation matrices with the GL view matix in the buffer and push it into the 
front view

Finally, it comes the motion animation
